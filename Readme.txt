🔐 Package Information
This package includes two powerful tools designed for advanced Bitcoin seed scanning.

Please note that each password is linked to your IP address.
If you are using a VPN and later change your IP, the password will not work again.
Each password is valid only for one IP and one device to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage.



✅ Features:

🔐 Remote Password Authentication — Verifies license remotely with device-based fingerprint

🧠 Seed Phrase Generation — Supports 12- and 24-word BIP39 phrases

🧮 BIP Derivation — Checks BIP44, BIP49, and BIP84 address formats

📄 Local SQLite Database Matching — Uses addresses1111.db to identify active wallets

💾 Logging — Saves previously generated seeds to avoid duplicates (generated_seeds.db)

🚀 Parallel Scanning — Utilizes multiprocessing for higher efficiency


💡 How It Works:

You start the program and enter your access password.

The script verifies your device and password remotely.

It generates seed phrases (12 or 24 words).
